    Mainland Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen
    was highly skeptical of Tokyo's explanations of the content of the
    newly published US-Japan guidelines for defense cooperation when he
    met Monday in Beijing with representatives of Japan's press.
    Qian also said the time is not ripe yet for a trilateral official
    dialogue among Washington, Beijing and Tokyo on defense, adding that
    "scholarly discussion" would be appropriate at the present.
    Qian's remarks indicate that despite explanations of the new
    guidelines by Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and Foreign
    Minister Keizo Obuchi, Beijing is still very worried about whether
    Taiwan falls within the sphere of the bilateral defense agreement.
    According to reports in the Japanese media, among Qian's concerns
    are:
    -- If the defense pact is a matter between Washington and Tokyo,
    it should be unnecessary to renew it, hence putting its content into
    doubt.
    -- Although the new guidelines do not specifically mention
    geographic criteria, there is still speculation that they cover
    Taiwan.
    -- Some have argued for raising the transparency of the bilateral
    agreement, while others advocate keeping it ambiguous and opaque.
    The American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) in
    Taipei on Wednesday appealed for an early conclusion of trade
    consultations between the United States and the Republic of China on
    terms for Taiwan to join the World Trade Organization (WTO).
    AmCham President Jeffrey R. Williams told a news conference that
    all AmCham members hope bilateral ROC-US WTO talks will be concluded
    as soon as possible to facilitate Taiwan's entry to the Geneva-based
    world trade regulatory body.
    According to Williams, most American business people with
    interests in Taiwan are convinced that they will benefit from
    Taiwan's WTO accession because Taiwan would be required to further
    open its market and better protect intellectual property rights.
    Williams, who just returned from a "doorknocking" visit to
    Washington, D.C. at the head of a 12-member AmCham delegation, said
    the US executive branch agreed with AmCham that Taiwan's WTO
    accession should not be linked to mainland China's membership
    application.
    "We agree that Taiwan's WTO entry should be considered completely
    on the basis of its own economic conditions," Williams said, adding
    that Taiwan is likely to conclude WTO-related trade consultations
    with the United States before the end of bilateral WTO talks between
    Washington and Beijing.
    During its stay in the United States, the AmCham delegation met
    with many Clinton administration officials and Congress members to
    exchange views on ways to help American corporations upgrade their
    overseas competitiveness.
    Williams said the AmCham mission had urged various US federal
    agencies to allow their senior officials to make frequent visits to
    Taiwan to help boost bilateral trade and economic cooperation for
    mutual benefits.
    Even though the Clinton administration was busy preparing for
    mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin's planned visit to the United
    States late this month, Williams said, many federal government
    officials still showed keen interest in listening to AmCham's
    suggestions and opinions about reinforcing Taipei-Washington trade
    and economic ties.
    As to the AmCham 1997-98 Taiwan White Paper, which he formally
    unveiled at a news conference held in Washington, D.C. last Thursday,
    Williams said the annual report mainly analyzed Taiwan's current
    economic and investment climate as a reference for American companies
    intending to invest in Taiwan, adding that the White Paper was not
    aimed at criticizing any party.
    The White Paper said Taiwan's restrictions on trade and
    investment across the Taiwan Strait have not only hindered the
    development of its own industries but have also discouraged
    multinational business groups from setting up a foothold on the
    island. It further claimed that the ROC government's master plan to
    develop Taiwan into an Asia-Pacific operations center would remain a
    pipe dream if Taiwan companies are not allowed to enter the vast
    mainland market directly and obtain access to its resources.
    Williams said AmCham's analysis was made purely from a commercial
    viewpoint, adding that AmCham members believe Taiwan must establish
    direct communications and transport links with mainland China so that
    Taiwan-based companies can make successful inroads into the world's
    largest market.
    Evergreen's green-colored ships and green
    matchbox-like containers are the hope of the port of Gioia Tauro in
    southern Italy.
    Taiwan-based Evergreen Marine Corp., which operates one of the
    largest container fleets in the world, is wagering on Gioia Tauro, a
    newly-developed and non-urban port area, attempting to build it into
    the third largest container port in the world.
    Evergreen is also targeting Gioia Tauro as a gateway to all
    Mediterranean-rim states and the Black Sea to the north, said a
    company spokesman.
    The Italian government has put up nearly US$180 million since
    1975 to develop the quiet backwater fishing port into a commercial
    harbor. With most parts of the development already finished, the
    harbor accommodated some 1,270 ships in the first six months of this
    year. The harbor bureau there estimated that its transshipment
    capacity may reach 1.4 million TEUs this year.
    Although the port is fully operational, its peripheral facilities
    are still in dire need of help, Aldo Alessio, mayor of Gioia Tauro,
    lamented. He noted that many support works have been left unfinished
    due to budget constraints, with highways in the vicinity only four
    meters wide and the nearby hinterland remaining undeveloped and
    blanketed by weeds.

3. My approach was pretty simple, I just used argv to accept a list of
   one or more filenames, iterated through the filenames, using gzip.open()
   to unzip each file. The resulting file objects were then passed to
   etree.parse() to convert into ElementTree objects in order to be parsed
   as xml. Per the suggestion in the assignment outline, I used xpath() to
   create lists of each element corresponding to a particular tag, starting
   with a list of all <DOC> elements. I opted to drill down to this layer
   first in order to only drill further into <DOC>s with the type tag "story".
   I then grabbed all <P> elements using another xpath(), this time drilling
   down two layers. Finally, once a list of all <P> elements in that <DOC/TEXT>
   element was gathered, I iterated through and printed the text contents of
   each to stdout.

   I didn't necessarily encounter any bugs (that I'm aware of), but it did
   take some time to understand how to use xpath() with multiple tags. I
   wonder also if there is a more efficient way of doing this, as although
   it is not necessarily *slow* for this dataset, having three nested loops
   could make it quite slow as the input gets larger.

Part 2:
1. Using nltk's sent_tokenizer, I found that this corpus has 579776 sentences!

Part 3 (Word Counting and Distribution):
1. In this corpus, there are 143410 types (# of distinct words).
2. There are 16678731 unigram tokens (total number of running words).
3. Please see rank-freq.png . This looks pretty similar to the one
   on the wikipedia page, which is what I would expect!
4. The thirty most common words are:
   ['THE', 'TO', 'OF', 'AND', 'IN', 'A', 'THAT', 'TAIWAN', "'S",
    'SAID', 'FOR', 'ON', 'WILL', 'WITH', 'IS', 'AT', 'AS', 'BY',
    'HE', 'BE', 'FROM', 'HAS', 'CHINA', 'WAS', 'AN', 'PERCENT',
    'ITS', 'HAVE', 'IT', 'NOT']

    It is interesting, the presence of "'s" in this set of words,
    as I don't think of this possessive suffix as independent from
    the word it is appended to. Certainly it carries meaning, but
    I'm not sure how much meaning it carries separate from the entity
    it was originally attached to. One way of getting around this
    problem could be to simply exclude this token when compiling
    ngrams, but as alluded to, this may be information that we would
    like to keep, but in the original context. So, as a preprocessing
    step, after word tokenizing, we could identify any of these tokens
    and append it to the previous word. However, this feels a little
    sketchy, since in the UPenn treebank it is considered its own
    type/tag ("POS" --> genitive marker, as nltk.help.upenn_tagset('POS')
    informs me). It may be worth noting that in part 2, I did notice
    that there were tokens that were not removed when excluding
    punctuation using just the set in string.punctuation, which likely
    would have shown up in the top 30 here. I just ended up including
    them in the list of tokens to remove, so they do not show up
    here. But, for the possessive suffix, I'd say that the best route
    to take would depend on the task.

5. Please see analysis.py
6. Unsurprisingly, after removing the stopwords, the number of
   types stayed roughly the same (143270), but the number of
   tokens decreased rather significantly (10100995). This makes
   sense as the number of unique words removed is small, but those
   words make up a great deal of the tokens in the original corpus.
   The top 30 words now are:
   ['TAIWAN', 'SAID', 'CHINA', 'PERCENT', 'GOVERNMENT', 'ALSO',
    'CHEN', 'PRESIDENT', 'YEAR', 'TAIPEI', 'NT', 'TWO', 'MAINLAND',
    'PEOPLE', 'US', 'NEW', 'CHINESE', 'ACCORDING', 'PARTY',
    'ECONOMIC', 'BILLION', 'FIRST', 'NATIONAL', 'ONE', 'FOREIGN',
    'WOULD', 'INTERNATIONAL', 'OFFICIALS', 'CITY', 'LOCAL']
   The list of stopwords provided by nltk, in my opinion, takes
   pretty broad strokes. For the most part, this list makes sense,
   in that all of the words are what I consider pretty common, and
   don't necessarily contain *much* meaningful content independant
   from context, although that feels like a risky statement. As
   far as surprising words, I'm not familiar with the token 'ma',
   and interestingly, when I tried to get more info using the
   pos_tag function, it reported back [('m', 'NN'), ('a', 'DT')],
   which was not terribly helpful. I did end up adding the possessive
   suffix discussed in question 4, as this seems to fall into a
   similar category of the words in this list.

   Speaking to my "risky statement", I suppose if we were,
   say, trying to identify the topic of a particular article,
   then these words are likely fine to exclude, but many of them
   do seem like they would carry important information in context.
   For example, for a task like sentiment analysis (at least as
   I currently understand it), I would think that words that
   convey negative or positive connotations would be pretty
   important, like "couldn't", "isn't", "wasn't", especially
   in larger contexts, e.g. "wasn't good" has a very different
   meaning if the "wasn't" was dropped. However, in a project
   I worked on where we were trying to train a model on
   single-word utterances derived from a spoken corpus, we
   decided to drop stopwords since they would have been over-
   represented. So, I think it really just depends on what type
   of problem you're working on, and what corpus is being used.

   The highest PMI pairs are not what I would have expected, but when
   inspecting the frequencies, it makes sense that these pairs would
   have high PMI, as they only occur once, thus 100% of the time they
   occur together.

Bulletpoint 2:
   I experimented with a threshold of 10, 50, 100, 250, and 500.
   With a threshold of 10, the results were rather similar to those
   with no threshold, although there were some instances where the
   word pairs, although having high PMI do have at least one word
   that does occur in other contexts (e.g., ('MUCOUS', 'MEMBRANES')).
   The top pairs were all still pretty uncommon in the overall set
   of bigrams. With a threshold of 50, we start to see more common
   bigram pairs with a higher frequency than the minimum dictated
   by the threshold. At this threshold, a fair few of the pairs
   correspond to proper names of cities, people, and companies, as
   opposed to the more esoteric pairs seen with the lower thresholds.
   This pattern holds for the threshold of 100 as well, but the
   individual unigram frequencies diverge a bit more, as the bigrams
   become more frequent (e.g., ('SYMPHONY', 'ORCHESTRA') has a
   bigram frequency of 103, and a high PMI, but the individual
   unigram components have frequencies of 143 and 180 respectively.
   It seems that as the bigrams become more frequent, there is a
   trend that the unigram components also more commonly occur in other
   contexts. Most of these patterns continue as the threshold is
   increased further, however at a threshold of 500, the bigram pairs
   correspond less to proper names of people (although some cities
   are present), and more to common phrases such as "metric tons",
   "last-minute changes" and "real estate". This makes sense, as
   these phrases can occur in many larger contexts, whereas the names
   of certain people likely only occur in articles...well, about those
   people!

   These are a bit more what I would expect -- word pairs
   that are somewhat common which understandably rarely
   occur in a different context. I guess these articles
   were from that period where mad cow disease was a hot
   topic.

Bulletpoint 4:
   The PMI for ("NEW", "YORK") is ~103346, which is pretty low
   compared to the top PMI's above. The bigram frequency is
   somewhat high, at 1928, and while the YORK unigram frequency
   is similar, at 1949, implying that YORK is typically seen
   in this bigram context, NEW is significantly more common,
   with a unigram frequency of 31251. So, the high probability
   of NEW will increase the denominator of the PMI calculation,
   bringing down the PMI value. Intuitively, although this
   is a common pair, and YORK may often be preceeded by NEW,
   we can't say the same for NEW (not nearly as predictably
   collocated with YORK).
